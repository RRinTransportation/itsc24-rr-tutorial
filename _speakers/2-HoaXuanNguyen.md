Hoa Xuan Nguyen is a civil engineer with expertise in fluid dynamics, computational modeling, and applying machine learning in engineering. He completed his Ph.D. at Trinity College Dublin in 2022, focusing on the dynamic response of floating offshore wind turbines. Dr. Nguyen was a teaching fellow at Vietnam Maritime University from 2011 to 2017 before advancing his research on offshore wind energy at Trinity College Dublin, contributing to EU-funded projects and collaborating on offshore wind farm design. He later worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics at Dublin City University, focusing on cloud system performance in collaboration with Huawei. Currently, he holds a Research Fellow position at Trinity College Dublin, where his work focuses on advanced numerical modeling, fluid-structure interactions, and the application of machine learning techniques such as Graph Neural Networks and Diffusion Models. Dr. Nguyen has published widely on topics such as floating offshore wind turbines, wave-current interactions, and machine learning in fluid dynamics. He has received awards for his research, including the SEAI National Energy Research Development & Demonstration Programme. He is also active in the academic community as a journal reviewer, conference organizer, and member of AVSE Global.
