#### Participant requirements {#requirements}

Participants should **bring laptops with installed required software** to participate in hands-on sessions.

##### For Session 1
Participants can use any preferred software tools to complete the hands-on activity. Examples of suitable tools include Excel, MATLAB, Python, or R for creating line and scatter plots. No specific software is required for this session.

##### For Session 2 {#requirements-section2}
This tutorial is designed to be accessible. We welcome all skill levels.

You will need:
- A [Github](https://github.com/) account (see [tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#creating-a-github-account))
- Basic command line knowledge
  - If you can change directories, create & delete directories, and run a python script, you'll be fine.
  - Otherwise, you can take a few minutes to learn how. Here are some tutorials for [Unix](https://cerfacs.fr/coop/unix-terminal) (Mac & Linux) and [Windows](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line).
- Software requirements
  - A command line program (E.g., Terminal or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for MacOS, Command Prompt for Windows)
  - git (see [tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/#installing-git))
  - [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)
    - ðŸ‘‰ For Mac users with M1/M2 chips, please still install the Intel version
  - A [Python IDE](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/python-ide)
    - ðŸ‘‰ We will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode). Install VSCode to best follow along.
- Knowledge of [git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and [python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) are helpful but not required. Part 3 of the tutorial ("Make it pretty") will benefit from proficiency in Python.
